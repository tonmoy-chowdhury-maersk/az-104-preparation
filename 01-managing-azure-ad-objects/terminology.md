## Feature: Azure Business-to-Business (B2B) for external users

Azure Business-to-Business (B2B) is a feature of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that enables organizations to securely collaborate with external users, such as partners, vendors, and customers, while maintaining control over their own corporate data.

With Azure B2B, external users can access resources, such as files and applications, that are shared by the organization's employees. The organization can manage the access of external users through Azure AD and enforce security policies, such as multi-factor authentication and conditional access, to ensure the security of the data being shared.

In short, Azure B2B is a way for organizations to securely collaborate with external users while maintaining control over their own corporate data and resources. The feature is included in the Free pricing plan for Azure AD.

The Azure AD Connect synchronization feature helps organizations to simplify their identity management by eliminating the need to manage separate directories for their cloud and on-premises environments. It enables organizations to keep their user identities in sync across both environments, and provides a seamless and secure user sign-on experience.

In short, Azure AD Connect synchronization is a feature that enables organizations to synchronize their on-premises Active Directory environment with their Azure AD environment, simplifying their identity management and providing a seamless and secure user sign-on experience.
